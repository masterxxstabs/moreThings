## 🧩 Modules

### 🎒 Backpack Module
Adds a customizable storage backpack. Currently, it has **no persistence**, so make sure **not to quit the game** or you will lose the items stored inside.

### 💼 Jobs & Robbery Module
Adds employment options across various businesses. Want to live the life of a hard worker? Go for it. Feeling a little rebellious? Rob them instead. Simple.

### 🪑 Furniture & Customization Module
Coming soon: furniture, clothing, and all kinds of cosmetic customization items to make your space and style truly yours.

### 🔫 Weapons & Gun Runners Module
Inspired by Fallout's **Gun Runners**, this module will introduce a black market gun stall with a unique NPC and lore-friendly custom weapons.

Each module will be individually toggleable in the config menu, so you can tailor your experience as you see fit.
